These “banana buds” actually smell and taste more like citrus, but their added length provides plenty of room for sticky resin, making this a potent strain with high THC levels. Since its effects are so active, this strain is popular for daytime consumption and has shown effectiveness as a treatment for glaucoma patients.

Bred from Master Kush and Bubba Kush, it’s popular for the treatment of pain, stress and insomnia thanks to the strong body sedation it provides. Master Bubba plants flower at 8 to 9 weeks with smaller, dense buds that can have a fruity, musky aroma. Kush earthiness is the main note in its smooth flavor. This strain can be very potent, making it best in the evening or as a nightcap.","Indica,Relaxed,Euphoric,Happy,Uplifted,Sleepy,Earthy,Pungent,Skunk"
909,Master Jedi,Indica,4.4,"Relaxed,Euphoric,Creative,Focused,Uplifted","Skunk,Spicy/Herbal,Diesel","The secret of the Jedis may lie in this powerful plant. We can only assume that Master Jedi was created in the Galactic Republic, most likely as a cross between Master Kush and Jedi Kush. When growing, these younglings are bushy and generally high yielders. Once they flower at about 8 weeks, the buds will give off the distinctly musky aroma that kush strains are known for. These kush traits come through in the taste as well along with a lemony citrus aftertaste. The indica Force is strong with this one and it definitely promotes full body relaxation, so make sure you’re ready to begin your training. Master Jedi may also be a Jedi 41 backcross. ","Indica,Relaxed,Euphoric,Creative,Focused,Uplifted,Skunk,Spicy/Herbal,Diesel"

Master Kush is bred by the Dutch White Label Seed Company, located in Amsterdam. During maturation the plant produces a subtle earthy, citrus smell with a hint of incense, which is often described as a vintage flavor. The taste of Master Kush is reminiscent of the famous hard-rubbed charas hash. This strain holds a superb balance of full-body relaxation without the mind-numbing effect that many indica strains produce. Instead, Master Kush offers a sharpened sensory awareness that can bring out the best of any activity.","Indica,Relaxed,Happy,Euphoric,Sleepy,Uplifted,Earthy,Pungent,Woody"

This strain, however, is not about brute “Force,” as the original Master Yoda would know, and the sativa side of this mostly indica buzz has just enough of an uplifting balance to please just about anyone. Master Yoda clinched 1st Place at High Times Los Angeles Cannabis Cup in 2012, where the OG Kush and Master Kush cross was already a local favorite.

914,Matanuska Thunder Fuck,Sativa,4.3,"Happy,Euphoric,Energetic,Hungry,Relaxed","Earthy,Woody,Pungent","Since many marijuana strains hail from the tropics or specific breeding hubs, it’s no surprise that this Alaskan hybrid’s name celebrates its origins. Developed from strains grown in Matanuska Valley’s grasslands, the flowers on these plants develop a frosting of icy white hairs that bring to mind its snowy homeland. Despite its rugged roots, these plants do best indoors but will still yield well in outdoor dry climates for the experienced grower. They will remain squat in size but tend to have very large leaves. This strain smells like hot chocolate with fruit, the latter of which can dominate the taste. Matanuska’s effects tend to come on slowly and then give a strong body buzz. It also goes by the less colorful name Matanuska Tundra, especially outside of the United States.","Sativa,Happy,Euphoric,Energetic,Hungry,Relaxed,Earthy,Woody,Pungent"

Lightweight sativa effects allow your mind to drift away to creative escapes, while Maui Wowie’s motivating, active effects may be all you need to get outside and enjoy the sun.

Its heritage lies in Brazilian, Indian, and Afghani strains, though Medicine Man is sometimes mistaken to be its close family member, White Rhino. These plants require a little know-how to grow, but when done right they should produce large flowers in 8 to 10 weeks. Medicine Man is a nice strain to look at, with a range of greens and sometimes purples and yellow and red hairs throughout its dense buds. This medicine has a fruity aroma, with just a slight sour note that isn’t quite strong enough to have you reaching for that spoonful of sugar.","Hybrid,Relaxed,Uplifted,Sleepy,Happy,Euphoric,Berry,Woody,Earthy"

Indoor growing is facilitated by the plant’s short stature, and its above average yield delivers particularly sticky, dense, pungent flowers. MK Ultra is renowned for its ‘hypnotic’ effects that are fast-acting and best used when strong medication is desired.
