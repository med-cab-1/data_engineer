Flavors can range from earthy musk to sweet mango, but without a doubt, what draws crowds to Harlequin is its ability to relax without sedation and to relieve without intoxication.","Earthy,Sweet,Woody","1655,1709,1229,255,628,630"

The light green buds have a covering of red or orange hairs and should be airy. This strain has a piney smell, but the taste is a subtle spiciness that is reminiscent of tea.","Earthy,Woody,Flowery","1701,1069,776,1041,1462,153"
