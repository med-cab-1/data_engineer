303 OG Kush,"303 OG Kush is a strain with various sources of origin. Below are several anecdotes about the strain's inception. 

Origin #1
303 OG, also called 303 Kush or 303 OG Kush, is reported to have first been cultivated in Colorado by the breeder known as Zombo and is an Indica-dominant cross between a Pre-'98 Bubba Kush and Reservoir ChemDawg IC3.

Reported by online sources to have been selected for its phenotypes by Colorado’s Hill Billy, the strain was named after Denver’s area code. Clones are the best option for cultivators looking to grow 303 OG, as seeds are not easily obtained.

Origin #2
The 303 OG grown by The Clinic in Colorado is an Indica-dominant cross between Kosher Kush and Ghost OG. Available throughout Colorado, flowers from The Clinic’s 303 OG strain provides a sweet and spicy flavor profile that’s popular for its OG characteristics, powerful body high, and cerebral effects.

The Clinic’s 303 OG Nug Run Sugar Budder won first place in 2014 for Best U.S. Concentrates at the Denver High Times Cannabis Cup. The Clinic’s 303 OG THC content has been tested as high as 20%, and the strain reportedly helps mitigate physical discomfort, apprehension, insomnia, and loss of appetite.

3 Kings (Three Kings),"While the original breeder of 3 Kings is unknown, the lineage of this sativa-leaning hybrid is made up of Headband, Sour Diesel, and OG Kush, three strains often crowned as royalty by the cannabis community. Available from several online seed banks, 3 Kings reportedly carries a tangy and sour aroma and moderate THC levels of about 16%.

Three Kings grows to a medium height, yielding moderate amounts of pale green colas glistening with frosty trichomes in an eight-to-nine-week flowering period. This strain is suitable for indoor or outdoor growing conditions, but is said to require some experience to properly manage.

Growers should expect 3 Kings seeds to harvest up to 600 grams per square meter indoors and up to 650 grams per plant outside. Some sources also suggest that certain samples of 3 Kings have tested for high levels of cannabichromene (CBC), a cannabinoid that has purported anti-inflammatory properties.",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
3X Crazy,"3X Crazy, also known as Insane OG or Optimus Prime, is a three-way cross of OG Kush, Bubba Kush, and Granddaddy Purple. This strain is said to carry an aroma of grapes and pepper with earthy undertones.

Insane OG is the name Dr. Greenthumb, a Caifornia dispensary launched by Cypress Hill rapper B-Real, gave its version of 3X Crazy. Pacific Seed Bank said the strain has 21% THC, low CBD, and an herbal, sweet, peppery flavor profile.

Abusive OG,"Abusive OG, or simply Abusive, was created or discovered by the breeders at Devil’s Harvest Krew sometime in the early 2000s. The cultivar is said to be bred from a rare cut of OG Kush, also called LA Kush for the city where it was created. Its genetic origins, however, are mostly unknown. Contrary to its name, consumers report that Abusive OG produces tranquil euphoria delivered with a fragrant, pine-smelling aroma.

New and experienced growers alike will have an easy time cultivating Abusive OG, which has a reputation for low yields. Abusive OG flourishes with Screen of Green (SCROG) methods and grows into a short, squat plant when it reaches full maturity in 60-70 days.

Acapulco Gold,"While its exact genetics remain a mystery, Acapulco Gold is a popular and historically significant sativa-leaning hybrid that thrives in outdoor grow environments and is indigenous to Acapulco, Mexico. As indoor cultivation becomes the go-to method for many growers, the original Acapulco Gold cultivar is considered to be a bit of a rarity within modern-day cannabis cultivation circles. 

Known to produce an energetic and cerebral high, a true Acapulco Gold plant is distinguishable by its sativa growth traits, yielding chunky colas that range from dark green to golden brown in color. Carrying an aroma that has been described as burnt toffee, Acapulco Gold is reported to produce an earthy, pungent taste upon consumption. 

Although the strain is best suited for outdoor growing conditions, cultivators should have less difficulty with the newer generation of Acapulco Gold seeds. Following a 60-to-70-day flowering period, one Acapulco Gold strain is reported to yield up to 500 grams per square meter indoors and, if properly harvested outdoors in the Northern Hemisphere by mid-October, up to 1 1/2 kilograms per plant.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
AC/DC,"ACDC is a phenotype of the high-CBD strain Cannatonic (also known as the CBD Queen) that was selected by Dr. William Courtney after receiving a packet of seeds from its original breeder, Spain-based Resin Seeds. 

The resulting ACDC, which is only available on the market as a clone, is exceptionally high in CBD, with a 20:1 CBD-to-THC ratio, according to testing from SC Labs. Resin Seeds describes the plant’s aroma as a mix of cherry, diesel, gas, and Mandarin peel. Myrcene is a dominant terpene in ACDC.

ACDC is a parent to several CBD-rich hybrids. Sin City Seeds offers four ACDC hybrids with varying CBD-to-THC ratios — Thunderstruck (an S1 hybrid of ACDC and ACDC), Treasure Island (Swiss Gold and ACDC), HarleSin (ACDC and Harlequin), and Incredible Power (OmRita, BluePower, and ACDC). 

Other notable hybrids include TOCI (ACDC and Xena), EMT (ACDC and Canna-Tsu) from Med Tree Seeds, Valhalla (ACDC and Sky Dragon) from Love Genetics, and CBD Rich Blessing from Bodhi Seeds. A hybrid of ACDC and a CBD-rich Good Medicine male, CBD Rich Blessing has, in turn, been used by its breeder to cultivate several other CBD-rich hybrids.

The strain reportedly grows to average height, producing thin leaves and medium yields of big, dewy buds. The strain grows best indoors and in warm environments. It’s reported to flower in 63-70 days, possibly longer in colder areas. ACDC can be finicky, so novice and intermediate growers with limited grow space may want to look elsewhere for a high-CBD plant.

According to several online sources, A-Dub has pale green buds covered with iconic red-orange hairs and glittery trichomes. It has a fruity, woody, spicy taste and strong sweet, earthy, sour aroma.

Growing notes online suggest that A-Dub grows easily inside or out, delivering high yields during an  eight-to-nine week flowering cycle.

Afghan Kush,"Afghan Kush is a landrace strain that originated in the Amu Darya River Valley, nestled on the border of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The cultivar grew in the wild for centuries and stabilized its genetic profile through continual natural selection. Considered by many breeders to be the backbone of today’s modern Indica strains, Afghan Kush is known for its sour aroma and reported relaxing, euphoric effects.

Breeders can grow Afghan Kush both indoors and outdoors, with a flowering period of 50-to-60 days, or in mid-October, depending on its environment.

Afghan Skunk,"Afghan Skunk, also known as Afghani Skunk, is an indica-leaning hybrid first crossed between an Afghan and Skunk #1 by the breeder Expert Seeds. Originally bred in the United States, the Afghan Skunk strain was relocated to the Netherlands in the 1980s to escape prohibition. 

The creators of Afghan Skunk describe the strain as having a spicy aroma and sweet, fruity taste. According to Expert Seeds, the effects of this strain border between relaxing indica-like effects and a heady sativa high that stems from its Skunk lineage. THC levels for Afghan Skunk typically average about 18%. 

Afghan Skunk is said to be a vigorous grower, but also relatively easy to control and maintain healthy vegetation. Following a 55-day flowering cycle, indoor Afghan Skunk can yield between 500 to 550 grams per square meter, while when grown outdoors it is harvested in September in the Northern Hemisphere and can produce an impressive 900 grams to 1 kilogram, or about 2 pounds, per plant.

Alaskan Thunder Fuck,"Alaskan Thunder Fuck (ATF) was originally cultivated in Matanuska Valley, Alaska. Sources are conflicted about the genetic origin of this strain, but most seem to agree it began as a cross between Russian Ruderalls and an unknown type of Northern California Sativa, later to be crossed again with Afghani Landrace in the 1970s. 

The initial nose scent of this strain may be off-putting to some as its terpene profile is fairly unique. Mixing sweet fruitiness (banana and orange) with an earthy skunk (pine, diesel), this is a strain more suitable for a developed palate. Fans of Jack Herrer may enjoy the classic fresh lemony-pine notes of ATF.  

Because of its creativity-inducing effects, ATF is a great strain for those who wish to consume while still being able to concentrate. Too, many say this strain lacks the typical crash that comes with a potent sativa. Since ATF is known for its intensely cerebral head high, those prone to sensitivity may want to take a conservative first puff or two and see how it affects them.

Breeder Medicine Man Seeds has a strain it calls Blue Frost, but it has different parents and doesn’t seem to be as well-known as Goldenseed’s version. Its variety is said to be a cross of Platinum Cookies, Grand Daddy Purple, and Blueberry Diesel, creating an indica-leaning strain that also takes on a blueish-purple color and emits a pungent aroma.

Blue Haze,"As noted by its name, Blue Haze is a mix of Blueberry and some form of Haze. Also known as Blueberry Haze, the strain’s exact Haze lineage differs depending on who you ask, some claim that Blue Haze’s parent in Amnesia Haze while other believe its Super Silver Haze. Considering the popularity of both Blueberry and Haze, it’s not surprising that multiple breeders have conjured up their own Blue Haze.

One proclaimed breeder of Blue Haze, Zatvio Seeds, claims that its strain has a sweet, fruity flavor and aroma, along with THC levels of about 20%. Zatvio’s Blue Haze is a sativa-leaning hybrid that grows tall with a slender stature, and is said to produce purple-blue buds drenched in resin in a nine-to-10-week flowering cycle.

Another breeder of Blue Haze is Homegrown Fantaseeds, which won first place for sativa at the 2001 High Times’ Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam with its Blueberry and Haze blend.

This award-winning indica-leaning strain is reportedly easy to grow and produces a high calyx-to-leaf ratio, yielding dense, musky buds after an eight-to-nine-week flowering cycle. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0
Blue Kush,"Blue Kush is a cross of Blueberry and OG Kush. The breeder, Dinafem Seeds, says this strain has 20% THC, dense buds, and the colors of the Blueberry family along with a woodsy citrus aroma.

The balanced hybrid is a heavy producer that’s easy to grow and flowers in about eight weeks  indoors or early October outdoors in the Northern Hemisphere.

Blue Magoo,"Blue Magoo is a cross between DJ Short’s Blueberry and William’s Wonder F2, also known as Major League Bud, reportedly created in Oregon sometime in the ’90s, according to seed bank Dutch Seed Shop. Carrying an aroma described as a fusion of berries and floral notes, Blue Magoo is best suited for indoor growing conditions.

Not to be confused with the similarly named strain Blue Goo, Blue Magoo produces dark green, trichome-crusted buds with hints of lavender in a seven-to-eight-week flowering cycle. Blue Magoo reaches an average height and yielding between 500 to 550 grams of flower per square meter, growers should expect zig zag branching and long petioles with this plant.

Bob Marley,"Named after the legendary Jamacian reggae artist and cannabis culture icon, Bob Marley is a strain of mysterious origin and lineage. Some sources claim that this sativa-leaning variety was created by the Dutch breeder Goldenseed, but the direct parentage of Bob Marely remains unconfirmed.

Bob Marley is reported to grow very tall, producing high yields of small, airy buds in a 56-to-63-day flowering period. Bob Marley is said to respond well to warm, outdoor climates and greenhouse grows. 

According to Amsterdam Marijuana Seeds, which sells feminized Bob Marley seeds, outdoor cultivators may expect harvests of up to 425 grams per square meter, while indoor harvests can measure up to 350 grams per square meter.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Bruce Banner,"Bruce Banner is a powerhouse strain with a reputation as big and green as its comic book namesake. 

Named for the Incredible Hulk’s alter ego, Bruce Banner was bred by Los Angeles-based Dark Horse Genetics to be one of the most potent cultivars on the market.

Using OG Kush and Strawberry Diesel parents, breeders created five phenotypes. Bruce Banner #2 and #4 were quickly dropped, while #1, #3 and #5 were selected for their high potency. 

When grown indoors, breeders can expect a flowering period of 9-10 weeks, as well as a high resistance to disease, mold and pests.

Bubba Kush,"Bubba Kush originated in the early 1990s as an accidental hybrid that crossed itself in Matt Berger’s garden. 

Also known as Bubba, Berger discovered a phenotype called Kush -- a cut of the Afghan Kush landrace strain that grew in the wild. While experimenting indoors with these Kush genetics, a crop of Northern Lights growing in the same room ended up intermingling with Kush, leaving behind a set of seeds. 

The seeds ended up growing into the first Bubba Kush flower, which became a major commercial success that attracted celebrity consumers such as Cypress Hill, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. Its popularity led to several copycat buds in dispensaries, so Berger renamed his genetics OG Kush to differentiate his crop from the rest.  

Bubba Kush is a mostly Indica-dominant strain, with short internodes, squat stature and broad fan leaves, thanks to its Afghan and backcrossed OG Kush heritage. It’s ready for harvest in 8-to-9 weeks, or in early October, producing compact nugs that sparkle with resin.

Bubble Gum,"The exact lineage and genetics of Bubble Gum remain a mystery. However, the strain’s history began in Indiana, where its original grower gave three different Bubble Gum plants to three Netherlands breeders — Adam of T.H. Seeds, and Cerebral Seeds’ Simon and Tony (who eventually split to form Serious Seeds and Sagarmatha Seeds, respectively). 

In the Netherlands, each breeder cultivated a slightly different Bubble Gum phenotype. Adam at T.H. Seeds describes his version as “mostly Indica,” while Simon at Cerebral Seeds considers his variation of the strain “mostly Sativa.” 

Bubble Gum has won 13 awards, including 2nd at High Times Cannabis Cup in 1995, 1st Outdoor at Spannabis Cup in 2005, 1st Outdoor at Spannabis Cup in 2006 and 1st Hybrid at the 4th annual Jack Herer Cup in 2018. 

Today, both regular and feminized seeds are available from Serious Seeds, and Bubble Gum is the only inbred strain offered by the seed bank. Simon reports Bubble Gum seeds produce a stable, uniform grow of strong, sturdy plants with thick stems. It lists the strain as both an outdoor and indoor cultivar, with an indoor flowering time of 56-63 days. It’s said to emit a sweet, bubble gum fragrance and carry a prominent strawberry flavor when it comes from feminized seeds.

Candyland,"Candyland (aka Kandyland) is a Sativa-leaning cross between a male Granddaddy Purple and a female Bay Platinum Cookies (which is more commonly known as Platinum GSC). 

Created by Northern California’s Ken Estes, Candyland produces thin sun leaves with tight, internodal spacing and dense buds that are known for resin content. The strain typically finishes her flowering cycle within 8-9 weeks of the 12/12 light cycle switch, while outdoor cultivators must wait until early October in the Northern Hemisphere, early April in the Southern Hemisphere, before harvesting.

Cannatonic,"Also known as the CBD Queen, Cannatonic is a hybrid from Spain’s Resin Seeds. Reportedly introduced around 2008, and among the first high-CBD strain, Cannatonic is a cross of Reina Madre and NYC Diesel. 

The strain took 3rd Sativa at the 2008 High Times Cannabis Cup and is primarily recommended for medicinal use. The seed bank offers three main phenotypes of the strain — one with a 1:1 THC-to-CBD ratio, one with high CBD and low THC and one with a high THC-to-CBD ratio.

It spawned several notable phenotypes, including Cannatonic #4, Cannatonic X and Cannatonic B, and Highlo, a Cannatonic IBL from House of the Great Gardener. One of the earliest phenotypes to carry its own name, SuperCBDx, was developed by breeder PJ after he contracted a serious illness and focused on high-CBD strains, which are commonly used for medicinal purposes. From there, it was reportedly refined by Spanish seed bank Genofarm, whose version boasts a 26:1 CBD-to-THC ratio. 

Cannatonic has also served as the genetic base for several CBD-rich hybrids including Cancer’s Nightmare (Cannatonic and White Nightmare) from Sin City Seeds, CannaBerry (Cannatonic and Blackberry) from Apothecary Genetics, Hawkeye (Cannatonic and Mt. Rainer) from RedEyed Genetics, Hazy Med CBD (Super Silver Haze, Skunk #1 and Cannatonic) from Poppa Pain Strains, and VCDC from Moxie Seeds. Resin Seeds’ own Dieseltonic is a backcrossing of Cannatonic and NYC Diesel, and has the same CBD potential as Cannatonic.

Cherry Wine and The Wife, two hemp strains commonly grown in the USA, are also Cannatonic hybrids. Resin Seeds estimates that 80% or more of all American, Swiss, and Italian grown hemp varieties include Cannatonic in their lineage.  

When cultivating Cannatonic, its breeder reports Indica-like growth patterns and a 63-70 day flowering period. There’s minimal genetic variation, according to tests from Phylos Bioscience. Resin Seeds also reports the strain is both pest- and powdery mildew-resistant and recommends indoor growing with a light source set higher than usual over the plants. Resin Seeds also reports that Cannatonic’s aromas range from strawberry, cherry, mandarin peel, and grape to haze and diesel; with myrcene being the strain’s dominant terpene.

Champagne Kush,"The perfect strain for a stoner’s New Year’s Eve celebration, Champagne Kush (also referred to as Champagne) is a popular hybrid strain with relatively muddy origins. Some sources claim this strain to be a cross between Super Silver Haze and Pot of Gold, while others have stated that Champagne Kush is a cross between a Hashplant and Kush that was pollinated with a male Burmese plant.  

The cannabis seed bank Seedism claims to have feminized Champagne Kush seeds from Super Silver Haze and Pot of Gold. This particular cultivar is said to produce high yields following a 10-week flowering cycle. Caramel and citrusy are common descriptors for the aroma of Champagne Kush, while the flavor is often reported as earthy and sweet.  

One sample of Champagne Kush analyzed by the cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 discovered THC levels of less than 17%, along with a terpene profile primarily dominated by linalool, which can also be derived from flowers and spice plants, as well as alpha-pinene, an herbaceous terpenoid that is considered the most abundant in nature.

Chemdog,"Chemdog, or Chemdawg, was created in the early 1990s in the parking lot of a Grateful Dead concert. 

Dead concerts had a reputation for being trade centers for cannabis cultivars, and during this particular show, a breeder named Chem purchased an ounce of Dogbud from fellow growers P-Bud and Joe Brand. The flower -- which supposedly originated along the California-Oregon border -- tasted so strongly of chemicals that Joe Brand nicknamed it Chem. Chem (the breeder) combined the two names, and Chemdog was the result.

Following the Grateful Dead tour, Chem popped Chemdog the seeds and created three phenotypes. The most famous was Chem 91, which became an instant success and served as the parent strain for some of the most popular cultivars of the past 25 years.

Today’s Chemdawg is a clone of the original Chem 91 strain. It’s bred by Humboldt Seed Organization as a phenotype with both Indica and sativa characteristics.

Several versions of Cherry Bomb exist; this one is not to be confused with Barney’s Farms’ discontinued Cherry Bomb or the legendary Cherry Bomb said to have been created by Mr. Greengenes from Maui Waui and Cherry AK47.

The mostly indica hybrid grows to a medium height and flowers in eight to 10 weeks, or late September to early October in the Northern Hemisphere, according to Bomb Seeds. Cherry Bomb is easy to grow either indoors or outdoors, with high yields for pro and amateur farmers alike. Its cherry taste and skunk aroma deliver a relaxing, mind-clearing effect, according to Bomb Seeds.


Cherry Bomb by Barney’s Farms
Barney’s Farms’ version of Cherry Bomb crosses a NorCal indica with a Hawaiian sativa to create a plant with uber green buds that are covered in glittery trichomes and give off a strong, bitter aroma, online sources say.

Chronic,"While the term “chronic” is used by many smokers to describe high-quality cannabis, the Chronic cultivar has been a legendary strain for quite some time. 

Chronic is a hybrid from Dutch seed bank Serious Seeds, which created the strain in 1994 by blending Skunk #1 with Northern Lights. Later, in the early 2000s, the seed bank crossed a hybrid of Skunk #1 and Northern Lights with a hybrid of Northern Lights and AK-47 hybrid to produce what exists today.  Seed bank owner/breeder Simon said he added AK-47 to the equation to upgrade the strain’s genetics and give it a “complex, full-spectrum high without losing the nice yield and flavor.” Serious Seeds carries both regular and feminized Chronic seeds.

Chronic won seven cannabis awards, including 3rd prize at High Times Cannabis Cup in 1994, 1st at La Bella Flor Cup Spain in 2003 and 1st at Highlife Cup Spain in 2004. 

Serious Seeds reports the sweet-and-spicy flavor of the original Chronic remains intact in its current iteration of the strain. It also reports high yields of enormous colas from Chronic during a 56-63-day flowering period. Chronic is best grown indoors but responds well to natural sunlight within a protected environment. 

The breeder recommends a long, careful and thorough drying process to maintain the strain’s terpene profile.

Cinderella 99,"Cinderella 99 (also called Cindy or C99) is a powerhouse hybrid with humble beginnings. 

In the late 1990s, Mr. Soul -- founder of Brothers Grimm Seeds -- discovered a few seeds inside a Jack Herer bud that he purchased in an Amsterdam coffee shop. He grew one into a cultivar named Princess, which reportedly provided a much more psychedelic experience than other strains on the market at the time. 

From there, he aimed to create a super-strain that would allow him to share Princess with the world. First, he paired a Princess female with a Shiva Skunk male to add plant strength, and used a triple backcrossing method called “cubing” to create the parent strain Cinderella 88. Finally, he bred Cinderella 88 with Princess once more to achieve what breeders call the Holy Grail of Hybrids -- Cinderella 99. 

The name Cinderella comes from the fairy tale heroine, who -- much like the cultivar -- had modest beginnings, but bloomed into royalty.

Clementine,"A cross between Tangie and Lemon Skunk, Clementine is a sativa-dominant strain produced by Crockett Family Farms, a family-run cannabis genetics company based in the Central Coast of California. The breeder’s Clementine Live Resin won first place for best sativa concentrate at the 2015 High Times Cannabis Cup in Michigan.

True to its name, Clementine is reported to have a sweet and citrusy aroma and THC levels that generally range between 20% and 25%, according to Crockett Family Farms. With a 55- to 65-day flowering cycle, this plant is said to produce large yields of dark green colas with firey stigmas and sugary trichomes. Clementine is well-suited for either an indoor or outdoor growing environment. After measuring a variety of Clementine, the cannabis testing laboratory Analytical 360 found that the sample had THC levels that reached 27%, as well as a terpene profile dominated by terpinolene, which has a woodsy aroma with citrus and floral undertones, and caryophyllene, a terpene known for its herbal spiciness.

Colombian Gold,"Colombian Gold is a Sativa landrace cultivar, created in the Santa Marta Mountains of Colombia. 

Through generations of inbreeding by local growers, Colombian Gold became one of the most stable cannabis strains on the market. While less popular than its cousin, Acapulco Gold, Colombian Gold still holds a place in cannabis history. Sam the Skunkman used it as half of his Skunk #1 creation in the 1960s, and it has been used for numerous hybrids over the last few decades.

As a true landrace Sativa, Colombian Gold produces tall, branchy plants that bloom within
75-90 days when grown indoors. However, a moderately experienced grower can tease out a November yield of up to 600 grams per square meter in an outdoor garden in the Northern Hemisphere, and harvest in May in the Southern Hemisphere.

Dosidos (Do-Si-Dos),"Do-Si-Dos is a hybrid of OG Kush Breath — a phenotype of Girl Scout Cookies — and Faceoff OG from Oregon’s Archive Seed Bank. 

The seed bank is working on an F2 line of Do-Si-Dos phenotypes — Do-Si-Dos #9, #18, and #22; as well as the unreleased #4 and #13 — all of which reportedly grow tall and deliver average-sized yields in a 70-day flowering time. The entire F2 line also shows hermaphroditic tendencies inherited from the OGKB parent in approximately 5% of the population, according to the seed bank. 

Of the three released phenotypes, #9 is described as the most potent, dense and resinous — producing heavy amounts of dry sift -- as well as a strong, cookies-and-kush aroma and flavor. 

Meanwhile, #18 exhibits thick, prominent resin glands and a strong OG Kush aroma, while #22 is a purple, aromatic, grape-flavored phenotype recommended for making ice hash.

Dream Queen,"Reportedly hailing from Southern California, Dream Queen is a cross of Space Queen and Blue Dream, two popular strains that combine to make a heady sativa-leaning flower. Carrying a purported aroma of tropical fruits with floral undertones, Dream Queen has a flavor often described as bubblegum-like. 

One sample of Dream Queen, tested by the cannabis testing lab Analytical 360, demonstrated high THC levels that exceeded 21%. The same lab results also showcased a terpene profile primarily consisting of alpha-pinene, humulene, and myrcene. 

Dream Queen is typically reported to grow tall, producing heavy yields of dense, bright green, white trichome-coated buds with orange stigma hairs. Following a 49-to-56-day flowering period, growers can expect harvests of up to 500 grams per square meter.

Durban Poison,"Durban Poison has deep roots in the Sativa landrace gene pool. The strain’s historic phenotypes were first noticed in the late 1970s by one of America’s first International strain hunters, Ed Rosenthal. According to cultivation legend, Rosenthal was in South Africa in search of new genetics and ran across a fast flowering strain in the port city of Durban. After arriving home in the U.S., Rosenthal conducted his own selective breeding process on his recently imported seeds, then begin sharing. Rosenthal gave Mel Frank some of his new South African seeds, and the rest was cannabis history. 

Frank, who wrote the “Marijuana Grower’s Guide Deluxe"" in 1978, modified the gene pool to increase resin content and decrease the flowering time. In search of a short-season varietal that could hit full maturation on the U.S. East Coast, Frank’s crossbreeding efforts resulted in two distinct phenotypes, the “A” line and “B” line. The plant from Frank’s “A” line became today’s Durban Poison, while the “B” line was handed off to Amsterdam breeder David Watson, also known as “Sam the Skunkman.” 

Durban Poison has a dense, compact bud structure that’s typical of landrace Indica varieties, but the flowers’ elongated and conical shape is more characteristic of a Sativa. When cultivated indoors or in a greenhouse, Durban Poison needs ample room for the production of side branches. Cultivating Durban Poison outside provides an opportunity for this plant to reach its greatest potential. Regardless of whether cultivated indoors or outdoors, Durban Poison requires thorough trellising to support its ample flower production.

Regular and feminized Durban Poison seeds are available through the Dutch Passion Seed Company. Durban Poison won 2nd place in 2013 and 2014 at the Denver High Times Cannabis Cup in the Medical Sativa category.

Dutch Treat,"Dutch Treat is a cultivar infamous among Amsterdam’s coffee shops, though its origins remain a mystery since it first surfaced. Some sources point to Vancouver, British Columbia’s Jordan of the Islands breeders as the creators of Dutch Treat. The cultivar is believed to be a combination of Northern Lights with Haze, reportedly resulting in cerebral effects with citrusy aromas and sugary sweet flavors.

Novice growers will have a relatively easy time with Dutch Treat, as this plant is said to require minimal care and is highly resistant to diseases and pests. The bushy, short cultivar flowers during an eight-to-nineweek period and by late September when grown outdoors in the Northern Hemisphere or March if grown in the Southern Hemisphere.

East Coast Sour Diesel,"Some cannabis consumers use East Coast Sour Diesel (ECSD) and the original Sour Diesel interchangeably, but they aren’t exactly the same. Created by Dr. Greenthumb, East Coast Sour Diesel is derived from Sour Diesel, producing a heady strain that, according to the breeder, has tested at a whopping 27% THC.

Dr. Greenthumb’s East Coast Sour Diesel has a flavor profile of diesel fuel. In a 60-to-75-day flowering cycle, this strain yields large amounts of chunky, light green colas coated with frosty resin and dark green leaves.  East Coast Diesel plants reportedly grow indoors between 21/2  to 3 feet, or 76 to 91 centimeters, and producing between 350 to 450 grams of flower; outdoors, it can grow between 4 to 8 feet, or 1.2 to 2.4 meters, and yield between 1 to 4 pounds, or 454 to 1,814 grams, per plant.

FPOG,"FPOG, formerly referred to as Fruity Pebbles OG, originated in 2006 and was bred by the California-based Alien Genetics team. The cultivar descends from a Granddaddy Purple x Green Ribbon hybrid combined with Tahoe Alien pollen (Tahoe OG x Alien Kush). The original hybrid from Alien Genetics was intended as a limited release, but FPOG was so popular that other growers quickly began cultivating their own plants.

Online sources claim that FPOG’s conical, densely packed buds and reported sedative effects suggest an indica heritage. The strain has massive bud appeal, with high levels of anthocyanins that create FPOG's contrasting purple, red, and green coloring. 

FPOG seeds and clones cost a pretty penny and therefore may be best left to more seasoned growers. Depending on the phenotype, this cultivar can grow tall and require ample growing space and topping.

The cultivators parted ways following its creation, and the cultivator who possesses the most “stable version” of Gelato genetics is up for debate. Cookies cultivates a few phenotypes and descendants of the strain named Gelato #42, Dolce Gelato, and a sun-grown Gelato. Sherbinskis grows four stabilized Gelato phenotypes in its rotation as well: Gelato #41 (Bacio Gelato), Gelato #43 (Gello Gelato), Gelato #47 (Mochi Gelato), and Gelato #49 (Acai Berry Gelato).

Ghost Train Haze,"Ghost Train Haze is a “flagship variety” from Colorado-based Rare Dankness.  According to the seed bank’s founder, Scott “Moonshine” Reach, the strain is a cross between a Ghost OG female and a Nevil’s Wreck male. 

Reach said the Ghost OG mother was sourced from Weedzilla of the Devils Harvest Krew (DHK,) and was traded openly with other breeders for more than a decade. He said the two strains produced a Sativa-dominant hybrid that’s easy to grow and offers heavy hields of sugary, trichome-rich buds in a 65-80 day flowering period.  

Rare Darkness carries both regular and feminized Ghost Train Haze seeds. It reports the strain has a hazy, sour aroma and results in an intense, energetic high. In fact, Reach said the strain was disqualified from its first competition because the entry batch tested at 27% THC, test results that judges assumed couldn’t be authentic. But since then, it’s won more than 100 awards globally, including 2nd Medical Sativa at High Times’ Cannabis Cup in 2013, and 1st Sativa at High Times’ Cannabis Cup in 2014. 

Reach noted that Ghost Train Haze is exceptional for making extracts, and produces a “wide array of terpenes.”

GMO Cookies,"No, the strain GMO Cookies is not a genetically modified organism but a cross between Chemdawg D and a GSC (formerly Girl Scout Cookies) Forum cut. Also know as GMO or Garlic Cookies, GMO Cookies has been attributed to the breeder Mamiko Seeds, but this skunky phenotype has also been said to have been discovered by a breeder named skunkmasterflex.

While Mamiko seems to have called it just GMO, dispensaries were understandably wary of having that “GMO” label on their shelves and went with Garlic Cookies instead. GMO Cookies is said to carry a flavor of garlic, mushroom, and onion that descends from its Chemdawg lineage.

Divine Genetics also has a strain that’s a cross of Chemdawg #4 and GSC that it calls Chem Cookies. Despite the similar genetics, it appears to be a different strain with different phenotypes for both parents,  although it’s worth noting that some people do confuse two strains. GMO Cookies is said to produce olive green buds with bits of purple and orange blanketed by a mantle of trichomes.

Neither seeds or clones of GMO Cookies appear to be available online, but some cultivators possiblymay be able to get a clone from someone.

GSC ,"GSC, which was originally known as the Girl Scout Cookies strain, was first bred by Northern California's Cookie Family sometime about 2012. A Sativa-leaning hybrid cross between a cutting of OG Kush and the breeder’s own F1 Durban Poison strain, GSC produces a plant with multiple branches and a powerful flower. The strain has a short stature that is common on strains with Indica lineage and is known for its tight internodal structure, which creates its iconic spear-shaped flowers with lavender calyxes. 

When cultivated indoors, GSC’s flowering time is approximately 62-71 days after switching the light cycle from veg to flower. Outside, growers will need to wait until mid-October in the Northern Hemisphere, mid-April in the Northern Hemisphere, for harvest. Regardless of wherever GSC is cultivated, the plant wants to grow tall and requires training, pruning, and full exposure to light to reach its maximum yield potential. 

The most popular phenotype produced by the first batch of GSC seeds was Thin Mints.

First bred by Mr. Green from the House of David Collective, the strain is a cross between three landrace strains, a Nepali Indica and two landrace strains from Thailand and Switzerland, which were then pollinated by a Colombian Gold male.

The strain was originally cultivated for making hash/concentrates, but rather than creating a resinous strain that was high in THC, the breeder ended up creating a strain that gained notoriety for its elevated CBD content. 

Harlequin produces tall plants with large yields and has a flowering period of roughly eight to nine weeks. Outdoors, cultivators can expect to harvest around mid-October in the Northern Hemisphere, mid-April in the Southern Hemisphere.

Haze,"Haze is a cannabis variety with unconfirmed origins that serves as one of the genetic pillars of a huge percentage of today’s Sativa cultivars. 

Online sources trace its beginnings to the 1970s, when Santa Cruz breeders known as the Haze Brothers cultivated Sativa seeds from friend, fellow grower and neighbor David Watson, also known as Sam the Skunkman. 

The brothers combined a landrace Mexican Sativa with a landrace Colombian strain. From there, the best females were selected and then crossed with a southern Indian landrace strain. Finally, the brothers crossed the resulting hybrid with a Thai landrace male to create what’s known as Haze. 

Sam the Skunkman took several of the brothers' Haze seeds to the Netherlands, where he sold the genetics under the name Cultivator’s Choice. Breeders loved the strain’s uplifting qualities and stability so much that it soon became the genetic backbone for many famous phenotypes and hybrids, including Neville’s Haze, Amnesia Haze, Purple Haze, and many more cultivars that won Cannabis Cups. 

Today, “Haze” is often used to refer to high-quality cultivars with pure effects that characteristic of Sativas. Growers can purchase Haze seeds from a variety of breeders.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Headband,"Headband by DNA Genetics
Amsterdam’s DNA Genetics used an OG Kush male to pollinate a Sour Diesel female and create Headband, a short and bushy plant during the vegetative phase that makes the most of the available space during the flowering cycle. The strain creates small buds and benefits from aggressive training as a means of improving the plant’s yield.

When cultivated indoors using the SCROG (screen of green) technique, growers will improve their overall yield and flower quality. Indoors, Headband flowers within 9-10 weeks. When grown outdoors, it’s best cultivated in areas with a warmer fall climate as the flowering time takes longer to mature than some strains. Feminized Headband seeds are available through Reserva Privada. 


Headband of Unknown Origin
Another origin of Headband is reportedly an indica-dominant cross between Sour Diesel and a Sensi Seeds Northern Lights cross. Once referred to as Daywrecker Diesel or Underdawg, this genetic combination joined together many commendable traits from its parents’ lineage. Headband was reportedly named Diesel #1 when an East Coast breeder known as Weasel first cultivated the strain in the mid-1990s.

Island Sweet Skunk is a Sativa-dominant Hybrid, reportedly a crossing of a Grapefruit female and Northern Lights x Haze male originally cultivated by Breeder Steve, Canadian breeder and founder of Spice of Life seed bank. The strain is reported to grow short and dense with light green buds, pale orange stigma hairs, and long-stemmed trichomes in an 84-98 day flowering cycle. 


Island Sweet Skunk by Federation Seeds

Island Sweet Skunk is a Sativa-dominant hybrid from Canada believed to have first been cultivated by Vancouver-based Federation Seeds. Online sources say it’s descendant of Skunk #1 that the seed bank crossed with an undisclosed Sativa strain. 

Island Sweet Skunk reportedly flowers within 49-63 days, growing tall and possibly requiring extra support for its exceptional height and heavy yields of dense, sticky colas. The strain is said to grow well using Sea of Green (SOG) methods but may require a warm, sunny, outdoor or greenhouse environment to support its size.

Jack Herer,"Named after the late, legendary cannabis activist and author of the 1985 book “The Emperor Wears No Clothes,” Jack Herer has achieved a lofty, heavily proliferated status among modern cannabis strains. Its flavor is reportedly a composite of citrus, pine, wood and spice. 

This creation from Dutch seed bank Sensi Seeds won 9 first-place High Times Cannabis Cup awards, and is a frequently used parent strain for new hybrids. 

Its lineage remains unconfirmed, but it’s generally thought to be a complex hybrid of Northern Lights #5, Shiva Skunk and Haze.

Jesus OG,"Jesus OG -- also known as Jesus OG Kush -- was developed while attempting to create a Sour Kush strain. 

Developed by West Coast seed bank TGA Genetics, the goal was producing a fruity-smelling hybrid with lemon flavor undertones to pair with its classic Kush taste. 

TGA co-founder Subcool said the recipe was perfected in 2007 by pollinating a clone-only female -- Hell’s OG that was held by Norstar Genetics -- with pollen from a Jack the Ripper male. 

Jesus OG has two main phenotypes: one with more limonene, which results in a lemony scent reflective of the strain’s Northern Lights #5 ancestry, and one with more Kush-dominant genetics that results in a pinene-dominant terpene profile. 

The high-limonene phenotype is reportedly the more commercial of the two.  

TGA reports cultivators of Jesus OG can expect tall growth and massive yields -- especially when planting outdoors -- with a 50-63 day flowering time. Jesus OG’s leaves are bright green, and its flowers are dense with waxy, trichome-riddled surfaces and prominent orange hair clusters. 

Breeder Subcool describes the Jesus OG high as intoxicating, yet thought-provoking, alleviating pain and providing mental clarity.  The strain was used by breeder Jinxproof to create the 9lb Hammer, which won a cannabis cup in 2017.

Jet Fuel OG,"Jet Fuel OG blasted off in Colorado, where experts at 303 Seeds dusted their Aspen OG females with a male High Country Diesel that was a hybrid of the seed bank’s Original Diesel/East Coast Sour Diesel. 

However, another source claims the strain originated in Southern California, the result of Dr. Greenthumbs’ genetics expertise.

So while Jet Fuel OG’s genetic heritage is debatable, its creators established the strain’s brand in 2017 to rise above would-be imitators and shine in its smelly splendor. The strain’s petrol stink and fuel flavor have the potential to propel users out of the stratosphere with a heady, energetic high that inevitably crashes into utter relaxation. 

The strain is a true hybrid, indicated by its moderate height and a 9-10-week flowering period. This lady is best grown indoors by moderately experienced growers who know how to cut back her top-heavy fan leaves and work with regular photoperiod cycles. 

The strain was reported by The Cannabist to be Indica-leaning, often clocking THC percentages in the teens, with few CBD or cannabinoids. 

With a bouquet of myrcene and caryophyllene -- and the lemony smell of limonene -- it may seem fitting the strain is also called G6, after the Gulfstream G650 jet, since both claim to offer luxurious effects.

Jilly Bean,"Jilly Bean -- a cross between a female Orange Velvet cut and pollen from a Space Queen male -- was created and bred indoors at West Coast seed bank TGA Genetics by co-founders Subcool and MzJill. 

Subcool told Weedmaps they picked up the Orange Velvet clone, called “Melvin” at the time, roughly around 2006 from a nearby family that had the mother plant. They crossed the female with their own Space Queen male, which was the last remaining seeds of its kind left at the time. 

Named after MzJill -- as well as for its candy-citrus, limonene and pinene-dominant scent profile and tropical jelly bean flavor, Jilly Bean was among High Times’ Top Ten Strains of 2007. It was named the magazine’s best Sativa of 2014 and took 1st place at the Adam Dunn Show Invitational.  

Jilly Bean is no longer carried by TGA Genetics and is now in the hands of MzJill’s seed bank, Oregon-based MzJill Genetics. According to Subcool, the Jilly Bean currently bred by MzJill is an open-pollinated F2 hybrid version of the strain. 

MzJill Genetics reports Jilly Bean grows medium to tall, with resinous, trichome-heavy flowers and leaves ranging from bright green to burgundy to purple. And its effects are described as uplifting, euphoric and giggly.

The OG Kush used to create Mega Wellness OG was selected from the father of its lead cultivator around 2002. It took breeders four years to find the perfect OG phenotype to create this strain.

The seed bank reports Mega Wellness is a deeply aromatic, high-THC strain with a complex terpene profile. Plants tend to grow tall and lanky with a 56-63 day flowering period. 

Nameless Genetics claims the strain’s effects tend to be heavy on both the body and the head, the result of its average 24-31% THCA content, which less-experienced users may find overwhelming. 

Tests from the breeder reveal a terpene profile that includes Mycrene, limonene, beta-caryophyllene, phytol and alpha-humulene — all of which reportedly account for its complex aroma with hints of diesel, black pepper, hops, and even citrus.

The strains Israel-based breeder Tikun Olam used to created their version of Midnight are a secret known only to the company. Sources online say the strain has an earthy, blueberry scent and slightly herbal aftertaste. Midnight has 8% THC and 11% CBD, suggesting mitigated psychoactive effects in keeping with Tikun Olam’s pursuit of medicinal cannabis. 

Since the company keeps a tight lid on all information except the availability of Midnight, there’s little growing information available. The buds are green and purple in coloring with a sugary coat of trichomes. Presumably, Midnight has good yields as it was developed for commercial production.

MIDNIGHT BY VANCOUVER ISLAND SEED COMPANY
Midnight is a cross of The Black and Fucking Incredible created by Vancouver Island Seed Company. It inherits its sweet and earthy flavor profile from the Fucking Incredible, according to the breeder.

As a relatively new strain that emerged in 2018, the seeds are reportedly difficult to source.  

With citrus notes and earthy undertones, this strain smells as sweet as the fashionable and fruity brunch drink it’s named after. A medium-sized plant that is well-suited for either indoor or outdoor grows, the flowering period can take around nine weeks.

MK Ultra,"MK Ultra is a hybrid first created by Amsterdam seed bank T.H.Seeds. 

The strain was produced by crossing an OG Kush female from Los Angeles’ JoshD Farms with a G13 male from Barney’s Farm in Amsterdam. The strain was named after CIA experiments conducted during the 1950s code named MK Ultra, during which experiments were performed on humans to develop drugs to aid with interrogation. The seed bank reports the strain delivers a strong, hypnotic high, and a long- lasting piney aroma. 

T.H. Seeds founder Adam Dunn said the strain is the first European cross to use an American OG Kush. The seed bank reports MK Ultra mainly has Indica lineage and grows short, producing frosty colas with high resin yields in a 56-63 day flowering cycle. The strain won 1st and 2nd Place Indica Cups at the 2003 and 2004 High Times Cannabis Cups, respectively.

Mochi,"Mochi, also known as Mochi Gelato and Gelato 47, is a cross of Sunset Sherbet and Thin Mint Girl Scout Cookies created by San Francisco breeder Sherbinskis. According to Sherbinskis, it tastes like the Japanese frozen dessert for which it’s named, fruity and sweet with a hint of mint. The strain’s floral scent mixes with earthy, vanilla undertones.
Mochi grows short and compact with a flowering time of 9-10 weeks. Sources online report it is moderately difficult to grow. The hardy plant produces plenty of large, tight buds that turn purple if exposed to cooler temperatures late in the season. Mochi is said to have great “bag appeal” with deep green and purple foliage, orange and red pistils, and a glistening coating of trichomes.

Monster Cookies,"Monster Cookies is reportedly a cross of GSC (formerly Girl Scout Cookies) and Granddaddy Purple, also known as Grand Daddy Purp or GDP. 

Carrying an aroma and flavor that are often described as a fusion between sweet grapes and earthy skunk, Monster Cookies is sought out for its reported highly relaxing effects. 

The indica-leaning strain is reported to grow short and stocky with ample vegetation, producing tight, medium-size buds that are blanketed with sticky white trichomes during a 56-63 day flowering period. 

Monster Cookies is reportedly suited for either indoor or outdoor grow environments. Sources claim that exposing the plant to colder temperatures shortly before the flowering cycle can lead to purple or dark blue hues among the forest-green-colored buds.  However, it’s important to note that Monster Cookies is a clone-only plant, and can be difficult for most growers to come across a legitimate cut. 

One sample of Monster Cookies, analyzed by the cannabis testing lab Analytical 360, showcased a high amount of the terpenes humulene, caryophyllene, and alpha-pinene. While this particular sample only demonstrated THC levels just above 12%, other Monster Cookies cultivars are said to contain THC levels that can reach up to 21%.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

The seed bank reports Nebula has a Sativa-leaning lineage, which accounts for its height, especially when grown outdoors with ample sunlight during a 60-to-65 day flowering period. Still, Nebula’s a versatile strain, responding well when grown both indoors or outdoors. It thrives under Sea of Green (SOG) grow methods. 

Paradise Seeds claims the strain produces heavy cerebral effects, testing between 18-22% THC. It won 2nd Place at High Times’ Cannabis Cup Amsterdam in 2005. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Northern Lights,"Northern Lights is one of the most famous and sought-after “Indica” strains of all time. Considered a descendant of Afghani and Thai landrace strains, the exact origin of Northern Lights remains a bit of a mystery. It may have originated in Washington in the 1970s, prior to reaching the Netherlands, where breeder Neville Schoenmaker pioneered several Northern Lights phenotypes in the ’80s for The Seed Bank, an early iteration of Sensi Seeds.

Since 1985, when Sensi Seeds first commercialized this strain, Northern Lights has been a landmark Indica strain in cannabis culture. Northern Lights #5 — arguably the most popular Northern Lights phenotype — won the Cannabis Cup in 1989, 1990, and 1992. Sensi Seeds currently offers feminized, non-feminized, and autoflowering Northern Lights seeds.

OG Kush,"OG Kush is a world-famous strain first propagated by Matt Berger in Florida. The strain was later popularized after JoshD was able to perfect the growing conditions and introduce the variety into the Los Angeles market. JoshD Farms reports OG Kush users can expect long-lasting, heavy, yet versatile euphoria and skunky-citrus flavor and aroma. The company is now focused exclusively on developing OG Kush-derived strains and products.

JoshD Farms reports an average THC content of 20% from OG Kush, with some indoor grows testing as high as 26%. Myrcene, Limonene, and caryophyllene are the dominant terpenes of the strain. According to JoshD Farms, phenotypes and offspring that honor OG Kush’s signature effect and flavor profile include Kosher Kush, Triangle Kush, Skywalker OG, and Loompa’s Headband. 

Matt Berger said he obtained the originating strain, a ’90s favorite of Snoop Dogg and B-Real of Cypress Hill, in Florida where it was shared exclusively among local growers under the name Kryptonite, or Krippy, to designate its alleged Seattle origins. It was shipped from Seattle to Florida in dense bricks and also referred to as Supernaut and Kush. 

Del Rosso said the strain was passed between Florida breeders Alec Anderson and Matt “Bubba” Berger in 1992. Berger, who was the first to cultivate Kush seeds in Florida from a random bag of flower, later shared the strain with Del Rosso in Los Angeles. Berger was also reportedly the first to coin the name Kush after a friend called the strain’s especially frosty colas “Kushberries,” with no intentional reference to the Hindu Kush mountains where other “Kush” strains originate.

Gorilla Glue was created by mixing Chem’s Sister with Chocolate Diesel and Sour Dubb. The results are a potent flower with a piney, chocolate, diesel aroma. It has a relatively high THC content, ranging from 25-30% while having minimal CBD content. It has been reported to make people feel relaxed, euphoric and sleepy, making this a highly popular strain among veteran cannabis consumers.

According to TGA co-founder Subcool, Pennywise began in 2007 when he worked with a rare Harlequin cut from breeder Chef Joel of Norstar Genetics, who holds the same Harlequin cutting today.  

According to TGA, Pennywise has four main phenotypes -- traits the earth pulls from the plant’s genetic code -- exhibiting varying amounts of coffee, lemon and bubblegum flavors. All four are reported by the breeder to produce both the relaxing, therapeutic effects of Harlequin and the invigorating effects of Jack the Ripper. Per Subcool, the goal with Pennywise is a 1:1 THC/CBD ratio -- with the most popular phenotype testing at 11% THC, 11% CBD.

G13 Labs claims it originated the strain in the mid-2000s, selecting Trainwreck and Hawaiian as parent genetics, and the hybrid soon proliferated among California medical marijuana dispensaries. However, many growers and 11 seed banks each aimed to create the “true” Pineapple Express. As such, multiple variations exist in the current marketplace.

Breeder Annunaki Genetics originally created its first version of Pink LemonAid by crossing Huckleberry Hound with Lemon Cheesecake. Later on, it swapped out Huckleberry Hound for Huckleberry Soda, already a top strain for the company, to concoct Pink LemonAid V2, a plant with beautiful pink and purplish-green buds. The resulting strain has a sweet, lemony flavor profile and about 21% THC, according to the breeder. Pink LemonAid reportedly has  very high resin production, and that there’s little difference between the two versions despite having two fathers.

According to Annunaki, Pink LemonAid has three phenotypes, two heavy sativa and one that leans more toward indica. The sativa-leaning phenotypes grow tall and lanky, flower in about eight weeks, and have average yields. The indica-leaning phenotype is short and stocky, flowering in eight weeks with a more earthy aroma and larger yields than the other phenotypes Its version of Pink LemonAid won first place in Mixed Light (Greenhouse) at the 2018 Emerald Cup in Santa Rosa, California.

Stardawg,"StarDawg, or Star Dawg, is a cross between a female Chemdawg 4 and a male Tres Dawg. Propagated by JJ Edwards of Top Dawg Seeds in 2011, Star Dawg is said to express a couple of phenotypes, one of which is considered Indica-dominant and the other considered to be Sativa-dominant. 

While the most famous StarDawg pheno, the Guava cut, won first place in the Best Sativa category at the 2012 Denver High Times Medical Cannabis Cup, the strain has been updated and reissued four times since 2011. 

The newest variations from StarDawg’s gene pool are referred to as the Illuminati, Corey Haim, and Kate Upton cuts. Despite sharing the same gene pool, each cut provides a slightly different flavor profile, smell, effect, plant structure, and flowering time. Of the varied cuts, Kate Upton is the most purple, Guava is the sweetest and produces the heaviest yields, while the Corey Haim and Illuminati cuts are claimed to be the most potent.

Dependent on the cut of StarDawg cultivated, the strain will either produce a short, compact, fast-flowering, Indica-dominant plant; or a fast-stretching, rapidly blossoming, Sativa-dominant plant. Indoors, the Sativa-leaning cut of Stardawg will finish flowering in roughly 63-73 days, while outdoor cultivators will need to wait until early October in the Northern Hemisphere, or early April in the Southern Hemisphere before they can harvest. The Indica-dominant cut of StarDawg, grown either indoors or outdoors, will take roughly 65 days to fully mature after entering the flowering period.

Super Sour Diesel,"Super Sour Diesel was created when breeders at Reservoir Seeds pollinated a Super Silver Haze female with pollen from Sour Diesel. 

Super Sour Diesel F1 hybrid seeds were only released once, so phenotypes are likely to be available as clones, though it’s possible a limited amount of seeds may be idling in a collector’s chest.

Advanced indoor and outdoor breeders can nurture the strain to heights of more than 6 feet, and it develops long, thin leaves for which Sativa plants are known. 

The best indoor yields are reported to result from a gentle touch, using Sea of Green (SOG) methods and other low-stress training techniques. With training, the plant is reported to produce between 1.25 to 1.75 pounds of flower per 1,000 watts of light.

Tahoe OG,"Tahoe OG was created in the Lake Tahoe/Mammoth region by California breeder Ganja Guru, who crossed OG Kush phenotypes to achieve one of the most potent phenos possible. 

The Tahoe strain contains all the excellence of its Kush heritage and its origin has been a source of confusion among breeders.

Several online sources report Tahoe was developed in the 1980s, but that timeframe is inconsistent with the 1992 emergence of OG Kush -- of which Tahoe OG is a phenotype. In fact, recent genetic testing confirmed certain Tahoe cuts are related to OG Kush.

OG Kush appeared when breeder Matt “Bubba” Burger brought his Florida-grown strain to new, indoor settings engineered by California’s JoshD of JoshD Farms. The OG stood for “original,” and indicated the strain was part of the ’92 cut grown by Burger and his team. 

From there, Ganja Guru moved a step further with Tahoe OG, selecting phenotypes based on THC levels and trichome density.

Tahoe OG grows short and squat, reaching heights of 4 feet in 8-9 weeks of indoor growing. Advanced growers should harvest from the top down, allowing lower buds to gain more light exposure. 

The strain reeks long before cutting, with alpha-Pinene and humulene contributing to its signature Kush aroma. 

Its desirability earned the cultivar 3rd place for Best Indica at the 2011 Cannabis Cup.

Bred by Amsterdam’s DNA Genetics and available in both regular and feminized seeds, Tangie crosses a select cut of Crockett’s Farm Tangerine Dream with DNA Genetics’ select male Skunk to create a citrusy plant with high yields of resinous flowers. The original Tangerine Dream was a cross between Skunk #1 and California Orange (also known as Cali-O).

Trainwreck,"Trainwreck is a cultivar with mysterious origins, most particularly about the meaning behind its name. Legend has it Trainwreck was so named because the original cut grew on a hill the same summer there was a train crash in the Humboldt region. Other sources claim the strain was named for the immediate slam of mental invigoration it had on users, which hit the mind like a runaway train.

According to the Seedsman blog, Trainwreck first emerged sometime in the 1980s from the Emerald Triangle region of Northern California. Trainwreck itself is thought to be a cross of several landrace strains, namely a Mexican Sativa, Thai Sativa, and Afghani Indica.

Lab tests show Trainwreck with high levels of the terpenes terpinolene, myrcene, and limonene, all of which contribute to its reported lemon and pine aroma. Consumers can point to its limonene content and moderate 14%-18% THC content for Trainwreck’s energy-inducing effects.

Origins_tk_og smuggled these seeds back to the US in 1989, and two years later he germinated those seeds and introduced the plants into his 12-light room once they were confirmed to be female plants. One of those Hindu kush plants hermaphrodited and pollinated the room of Emerald Triangle plants. 

The resulting seeds went on to play a significant role in shaping the landscape of cannabis genetics in the United States. One of the seeds eventually became Triangle Kush while another became the OG Kush.
