303 OG Kush,303-og-kush,hybrid,"303 OG Kush is a strain with various sources of origin. Below are several anecdotes about the strain's inception. 

Origin #1
303 OG, also called 303 Kush or 303 OG Kush, is reported to have first been cultivated in Colorado by the breeder known as Zombo and is an Indica-dominant cross between a Pre-'98 Bubba Kush and Reservoir ChemDawg IC3.

Reported by online sources to have been selected for its phenotypes by Colorado’s Hill Billy, the strain was named after Denver’s area code. Clones are the best option for cultivators looking to grow 303 OG, as seeds are not easily obtained.

Origin #2
The 303 OG grown by The Clinic in Colorado is an Indica-dominant cross between Kosher Kush and Ghost OG. Available throughout Colorado, flowers from The Clinic’s 303 OG strain provides a sweet and spicy flavor profile that’s popular for its OG characteristics, powerful body high, and cerebral effects.

The Clinic’s 303 OG Nug Run Sugar Budder won first place in 2014 for Best U.S. Concentrates at the Denver High Times Cannabis Cup. The Clinic’s 303 OG THC content has been tested as high as 20%, and the strain reportedly helps mitigate physical discomfort, apprehension, insomnia, and loss of appetite.

Following an eight-week flowering period, growers should expect to harvest high yields of airy, cone-shaped buds with amber-colored hairs and sandy trichomes.

Big Bud,big-bud,hybrid,"True to its name, Big Bud is a high-yielding strain of extra large, frosty, sweet-smelling buds. 

It began its life in the U.S. from Sensi Seeds growers as a hybrid of Afghani, Skunk and possibly Northern Lights strains. 

In clone form, Big Bud made its way to the Netherlands in the 1980s to escape America’s war on drugs. As it proliferated in Amsterdam and became a commercial strain, U.S.-based Sensi Seed growers tracked down and back-crossed the strain with the genotype of its original Afghani parent. The result was the more stabilized, award-winning Big Bud that exists today.

The strain won 1st Indica at High Times’ Cannabis Cup in 1989. 

Today, its growth characteristics remain impressive. Advanced growers may be more comfortable with the strain, as it often requires extra branch support to keep its massive buds from snapping the stems. It quickly grows tall with a flowering time of 50-65 days, and does best outdoors in a warm climate.

Blue Dream,blue-dream,hybrid,"Blue Dream is a popular strain with various sources of origin. Below are several anecdotes about the strain's inception. 

Origin 1
The clone-only version of Blue Dream is a Sativa-dominant hybrid that was first cultivated in Northern California. A cross of DJ Short’s Blueberry F5 strain and Santa Cruz Haze, Blue Dream produces several noteworthy phenotypes and is known to produce varied phenotypes with heavy yields.

Origin 2 
Blue Dream by Mystic Seeds is an Indica-dominant cross of DJ Short’s Blueberry strain crossed with a powerful OG Kush from Los Angeles. 

Origin 3
A new Blue Dream by DJ Short was reportedly recently created and branded as Azure Haze, after crossing a Silver Haze mother and a Blueberry F4 father. 

Origin 4
Blue Dream by Humboldt Seed Organization is a Sativa-dominant strain derived from feminized seeds. Created from a cross of Blueberry and Super Silver Haze (SSH), this version of Blue Dream is suitable for cultivating indoors or in a greenhouse.","Origin 1
When cultivated outdoors, Blue Dream hits full maturation by late October in the Northern Hemisphere, late April in the Southern Hemisphere. The strain thrives when grown indoors in a hydroponic environment and finishes flowering about 8 to 10 weeks after the 12/12 light cycle switch, according to Dark Heart Nursery. For a more robust flavor profile, many growers choose to cultivate this strain in soil with organic nutrients.

Origin 2
This version of Blue Dream is known for producing a short, dark-green plant that grows slowly in the vegetative phase and produces modest yields. Due to the Kush influence, this variety is an early-stretching plant that takes on more Indica qualities when flowering and finishes with chunky, pungent blue-hued flowers. This version of Blue Dream is considered to be a good commercial strain that’s highly resistant to mold and pests. 

Origin 3
DJ Short’s version of Blue Dream grows relatively slow during the vegetation cycle and stretches dramatically once the flower cycle begins. Training these plants via the Sea of Green or Screen of Green technique helps to maximize yield. DJ Short’s Blue Dream strain produces dense, rounded flowers that create an above-average yield.

Origin 4
The strain’s growth pattern is slender with narrow fan leaves. The light green calyxes turn golden near harvest time and typically produce swollen teardrop-shaped colas that outproduce other versions of this strain. 

Humboldt Seeds also offers an autoflowering version of Blue Dream that’s ready for harvest about 11 weeks after planting. The autoflowering Blue Dream strain produces a short,  bushy plant that produces long side-branches with wide internodal spacing. From seed to smoke, Blue Dream Auto is typically ready for harvest within 75 days of germination. Featuring a rich Blueberry Haze flavor, this auto hybrid is zesty enough to entice skilled growers and simple enough for novice cultivators to gain their first taste of success.

While experimenting indoors with these Kush genetics, a crop of Northern Lights growing in the same room ended up intermingling with Kush, leaving behind a set of seeds. 

The seeds ended up growing into the first Bubba Kush flower, which became a major commercial success that attracted celebrity consumers such as Cypress Hill, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. Its popularity led to several copycat buds in dispensaries, so Berger renamed his genetics OG Kush to differentiate his crop from the rest.

Bubba OG is reported to grow medium-size buds covered in frosty trichomes and spotted with orange stigmas in a 60-to-70-day flowering period. The strain can be grown either indoors or outdoors, but may respond most favorably to Sea of Green (SoG) methods, which can yield between 350 grams to 450 grams per square meter. 

When grown indoors, cultivators can expect Bubba OG to grow between 18 to 21 inches tall, or 46 to 53 centimeters tall,while outdoor plants can grow to a height of 3 to 8 feet, or 0.9 to 2.4 meters .

Bubble Gum,bubble-gum,hybrid,"The exact lineage and genetics of Bubble Gum remain a mystery.

Seeds, and Cerebral Seeds’ Simon and Tony (who eventually split to form Serious Seeds and Sagarmatha Seeds, respectively). 

In the Netherlands, each breeder cultivated a slightly different Bubble Gum phenotype. Adam at T.H. Seeds describes his version as “mostly Indica,” while Simon at Cerebral Seeds considers his variation of the strain “mostly Sativa.” 

Bubble Gum has won 13 awards, including 2nd at High Times Cannabis Cup in 1995, 1st Outdoor at Spannabis Cup in 2005, 1st Outdoor at Spannabis Cup in 2006 and 1st Hybrid at the 4th annual Jack Herer Cup in 2018. 

Today, both regular and feminized seeds are available from Serious Seeds, and Bubble Gum is the only inbred strain offered by the seed bank. Simon reports Bubble Gum seeds produce a stable, uniform grow of strong, sturdy plants with thick stems. It lists the strain as both an outdoor and indoor cultivar, with an indoor flowering time of 56-63 days. It’s said to emit a sweet, bubble gum fragrance and carry a prominent strawberry flavor when it comes from feminized seeds.

The strain took 3rd Sativa at the 2008 High Times Cannabis Cup and is primarily recommended for medicinal use. The seed bank offers three main phenotypes of the strain — one with a 1:1 THC-to-CBD ratio, one with high CBD and low THC and one with a high THC-to-CBD ratio.

It spawned several notable phenotypes, including Cannatonic #4, Cannatonic X and Cannatonic B, and Highlo, a Cannatonic IBL from House of the Great Gardener. One of the earliest phenotypes to carry its own name, SuperCBDx, was developed by breeder PJ after he contracted a serious illness and focused on high-CBD strains, which are commonly used for medicinal purposes. From there, it was reportedly refined by Spanish seed bank Genofarm, whose version boasts a 26:1 CBD-to-THC ratio. 

Cannatonic has also served as the genetic base for several CBD-rich hybrids including Cancer’s Nightmare (Cannatonic and White Nightmare) from Sin City Seeds, CannaBerry (Cannatonic and Blackberry) from Apothecary Genetics, Hawkeye (Cannatonic and Mt. Rainer) from RedEyed Genetics, Hazy Med CBD (Super Silver Haze, Skunk #1 and Cannatonic) from Poppa Pain Strains, and VCDC from Moxie Seeds. Resin Seeds’ own Dieseltonic is a backcrossing of Cannatonic and NYC Diesel, and has the same CBD potential as Cannatonic.

The offspring of two respected strains, Canna-Tsu expresses Indica-like growth patterns during the vegetative cycle. Producing a squat and sturdy plant structure, Canna-Tsu generates a medium-yielding plant of flowers rich in CBD and adjusts easily to different cultivation environments. Canna-Tsu starts low and wide during the vegetative cycle and develops abundant foliage with multiple branches as it enters the flowering cycle. Cultivated outdoors, the flowers tend to reach full maturation by late October in the Northern Hemisphere, late April in the Southern Hemisphere. Indoors, growers will typically see their plants finish flowering roughly 70 days after entering the flowering cycle.

Canna-Tsu has a characteristically high CBD:THC ratio of roughly 1:1 and produces a relatively balanced effect. The strain, tested by Analytical 360 in 2013, tested at 10.93% for total CBD content and less than 9% THC. Canna-Tsu has a citrusy aroma and is typically high in the linalool terpene.

Cat Piss,cat-piss,hybrid,"Cat Piss is a strain with various sources of origin. Below are several anecdotes about the strain's inception. 

Origin #1
The clone-only version of Cat Piss was derived from a select phenotype of Super Silver Haze. Her flowers are rock-hard and shaped like a small pine cone with a glowing neon-green hue. Cat Piss has shades of dark green and lavender that will remind you of a tropical jungle. Her flowers are littered with long, deep, amber-colored hairs with a thick resin coating.

When cultivated indoors, Cat Piss typically completes a flowering cycle within 65 days of the 12/12 light cycle switch. As a Sativa-dominant clone, this strain responds well to low-stress training (LST). When grown in a Screen of Green (SCROG) environment, cultivators will witness an increase in vegetation and ultimately higher yields. Cat Piss thrives in both indoor and outdoor grow environments and is known to produce moderate yields when left untrained. The flavors are spiced with an ammonia nose, and the effect works well at managing stress and depression. 

Note: In cannabis folklore, Cat Piss has two other origin stories. SoCal Cat Piss was derived from the famed TrainWreck strain, while NorCal Cat Piss is thought to be related to an Afghani landrace.

Origin #2
SoCal Cat Piss (Catpiss) is a Sativa-dominant clone-only strain that was purportedly derived from the Trainwreck strain. This version of Cat Piss has an Indica plant structure and growth pattern that produces a shorter plant with a skunky essence. SoCal Cat Piss is known for its abundant yields and its medicinal effects. 

Origin #3
NorCal Cat Piss is an Indica-leaning clone only strain that was tracked down and saved by Shabud, a well-known member of the online forum community Overgrow.com. As the story goes, Norcal Cat Piss inspired Shabud’s early growing career and he spent the next 15 years looking for the strain.

Enter the Stanley Brothers. They later created a strain called Hippie’s Disappointment -- named for its lack of intoxicating effects from its 30:1 CBD-to-THC ratio. They gave extracted oil from the cultivar to the Figi family, and it worked so well, the brothers renamed the strain in Charlotte’s honor.

Charlotte’s Web quickly gained national acclaim with the help of positive reviews from Dr. Sanjay Gupta, whose anti-cannabis opinions were radically swayed by the effectiveness of low-THC cannabis, and success stories from both pediatric and adult patients whose seizures were eased.

Later, in the early 2000s, the seed bank crossed a hybrid of Skunk #1 and Northern Lights with a hybrid of Northern Lights and AK-47 hybrid to produce what exists today.

Serious Seeds reports the sweet-and-spicy flavor of the original Chronic remains intact in its current iteration of the strain. It also reports high yields of enormous colas from Chronic during a 56-63-day flowering period. Chronic is best grown indoors but responds well to natural sunlight within a protected environment.

The entire F2 line also shows hermaphroditic tendencies inherited from the OGKB parent in approximately 5% of the population, according to the seed bank. 

Of the three released phenotypes, #9 is described as the most potent, dense and resinous — producing heavy amounts of dry sift -- as well as a strong, cookies-and-kush aroma and flavor. 

Meanwhile, #18 exhibits thick, prominent resin glands and a strong OG Kush aroma, while #22 is a purple, aromatic, grape-flavored phenotype recommended for making ice hash. 

Archive hasn’t released much information about the original Do-Si-Dos, but carries the strain in regular, non-feminized seed form. Regular Do-Si-Dos #9, #18 and #22 seeds are currently available.

Durban Poison,durban-poison,sativa,"Durban Poison has deep roots in the Sativa landrace gene pool. The strain’s historic phenotypes were first noticed in the late 1970s by one of America’s first International strain hunters, Ed Rosenthal. According to cultivation legend, Rosenthal was in South Africa in search of new genetics and ran across a fast flowering strain in the port city of Durban. After arriving home in the U.S., Rosenthal conducted his own selective breeding process on his recently imported seeds, then begin sharing. Rosenthal gave Mel Frank some of his new South African seeds, and the rest was cannabis history. 

Frank, who wrote the “Marijuana Grower’s Guide Deluxe"" in 1978, modified the gene pool to increase resin content and decrease the flowering time. In search of a short-season varietal that could hit full maturation on the U.S. East Coast, Frank’s crossbreeding efforts resulted in two distinct phenotypes, the “A” line and “B” line. The plant from Frank’s “A” line became today’s Durban Poison, while the “B” line was handed off to Amsterdam breeder David Watson, also known as “Sam the Skunkman.” 

Durban Poison has a dense, compact bud structure that’s typical of landrace Indica varieties, but the flowers’ elongated and conical shape is more characteristic of a Sativa. When cultivated indoors or in a greenhouse, Durban Poison needs ample room for the production of side branches. Cultivating Durban Poison outside provides an opportunity for this plant to reach its greatest potential. Regardless of whether cultivated indoors or outdoors, Durban Poison requires thorough trellising to support its ample flower production.

Regular and feminized Durban Poison seeds are available through the Dutch Passion Seed Company. Durban Poison won 2nd place in 2013 and 2014 at the Denver High Times Cannabis Cup in the Medical Sativa category.

Ghost Train Haze,ghost-train-haze,hybrid,"Ghost Train Haze is a “flagship variety” from Colorado-based Rare Dankness.  According to the seed bank’s founder, Scott “Moonshine” Reach, the strain is a cross between a Ghost OG female and a Nevil’s Wreck male. 

Reach said the Ghost OG mother was sourced from Weedzilla of the Devils Harvest Krew (DHK,) and was traded openly with other breeders for more than a decade. He said the two strains produced a Sativa-dominant hybrid that’s easy to grow and offers heavy hields of sugary, trichome-rich buds in a 65-80 day flowering period.  

Rare Darkness carries both regular and feminized Ghost Train Haze seeds. It reports the strain has a hazy, sour aroma and results in an intense, energetic high. In fact, Reach said the strain was disqualified from its first competition because the entry batch tested at 27% THC, test results that judges assumed couldn’t be authentic. But since then, it’s won more than 100 awards globally, including 2nd Medical Sativa at High Times’ Cannabis Cup in 2013, and 1st Sativa at High Times’ Cannabis Cup in 2014. 

Reach noted that Ghost Train Haze is exceptional for making extracts, and produces a “wide array of terpenes.”

Golden Soda was created in an attempt to increase the Huckleberry Soda plant’s yield, which led to the creation of three different phenotypes found in their seeds. 

Golden Soda – F1
Phenotype #1 is sturdy an indica-leaning cultivar that grows with moderate vigor to an average height, producing copious amounts of short internodes and highly branched nodes. Following a 60-to-65 day flowering cycle, this variety of Golden Soda produces extra large yields of green and gold-colored colas with high milky resin content and orange stigma hairs. According to the breeder, this phenotype has an aroma of citrus soda, vanilla, tropical fruit, and pepper.

Golden Soda – F2
Unlike the other two phenotypes, the second variety of Golden Soda is said to lean toward the sativa side of the spectrum, which explains why this second phenotype is said to be a vigorous grower that leads to a tell, stretching plant with long internode spacing. Following a 57-to-62-day flowering period, this Golden Soda phenotype sprouts moderate yields of densely packed colas spotted with shades of green, gold, and pink. Also known to produce copious amounts of resin, this sativa-leaning cultivar has a subtle aroma of peaches, mango, pepper and earth. 

Golden Soda – F3
The third phenotype offered by Annunaki Genetics is an indica-leaning strain that is incredibly short and compact, growing with low vigor and maturing faster than the other two phenotypes. In a 56-to-61-day flowering cycle, this Golden Soda variety produces dense flowers that are green and light purple in color, while also spotted with soft orange stigma hairs. Although this phenotype is said to produce large yields, it’s also said to have a lower resin content than the other two phenotypes.

The strain has a short stature that is common on strains with Indica lineage and is known for its tight internodal structure, which creates its iconic spear-shaped flowers with lavender calyxes. 

When cultivated indoors, GSC’s flowering time is approximately 62-71 days after switching the light cycle from veg to flower. Outside, growers will need to wait until mid-October in the Northern Hemisphere, mid-April in the Northern Hemisphere, for harvest. Regardless of wherever GSC is cultivated, the plant wants to grow tall and requires training, pruning, and full exposure to light to reach its maximum yield potential. 

The most popular phenotype produced by the first batch of GSC seeds was Thin Mints.

Haze,haze,hybrid,"Haze is a cannabis variety with unconfirmed origins that serves as one of the genetic pillars of a huge percentage of today’s Sativa cultivars. 

Online sources trace its beginnings to the 1970s, when Santa Cruz breeders known as the Haze Brothers cultivated Sativa seeds from friend, fellow grower and neighbor David Watson, also known as Sam the Skunkman. 

The brothers combined a landrace Mexican Sativa with a landrace Colombian strain. From there, the best females were selected and then crossed with a southern Indian landrace strain. Finally, the brothers crossed the resulting hybrid with a Thai landrace male to create what’s known as Haze. 

Sam the Skunkman took several of the brothers' Haze seeds to the Netherlands, where he sold the genetics under the name Cultivator’s Choice. Breeders loved the strain’s uplifting qualities and stability so much that it soon became the genetic backbone for many famous phenotypes and hybrids, including Neville’s Haze, Amnesia Haze, Purple Haze, and many more cultivars that won Cannabis Cups.

Amsterdam’s DNA Genetics used an OG Kush male to pollinate a Sour Diesel female and create Headband, a short and bushy plant during the vegetative phase that makes the most of the available space during the flowering cycle. The strain creates small buds and benefits from aggressive training as a means of improving the plant’s yield.

When cultivated indoors using the SCROG (screen of green) technique, growers will improve their overall yield and flower quality. Indoors, Headband flowers within 9-10 weeks. When grown outdoors, it’s best cultivated in areas with a warmer fall climate as the flowering time takes longer to mature than some strains. Feminized Headband seeds are available through Reserva Privada. 


Headband of Unknown Origin
Another origin of Headband is reportedly an indica-dominant cross between Sour Diesel and a Sensi Seeds Northern Lights cross. Once referred to as Daywrecker Diesel or Underdawg, this genetic combination joined together many commendable traits from its parents’ lineage.

Jack's Cleaner,jack-s-cleaner,hybrid,"The legend of this strain begins when legendary breeder TGA Genetics’ Subcool received a mix of Pluton, Lambsbread, Purple Haze, and Northern Lights seeds from a friend. One of the plants had a particularly lemony scent, but the plant was too spindly to produce adequate harvests. And so, Subcool reportedly crossed it with a Jack Herer and Jack’s Cleaner was born.

It’s said that the breeder never sold this version of Jack’s Cleaner and only gave away one plant. Subcool now offers Jack’s Cleaner 2, however, a backcross of his original Jack Herer and Jack the Ripper, which was created in an attempt to bring his famous Jack’s Cleaner to seed form. Subcool’s seed bank, called The Dank, states that Jack’s Cleaner 2 is a lemon-scented, sweet-tasting and incredibly potent strain.

The sativa-leaning hybrid grows tall and tends to stretch, producing high yields of resin-coated colas in an eight-to-10 week flowering cycle. Jack’s Cleaner 2 is said to thrive with the Screen of Green (ScrOG) method, and needs pruning or topping to control the plant’s vigorous growth.

According to the breeder, Jack’s Cleaner 2 delivers strong, uplifting effects, and could be an effective strain for those seeking  pain relief. Some claim that the highly resinous and citrusy Jack’s Cleaner 2 is an ideal candidate for cannabis concentrates, especially bubble hash.

Jesus OG,jesus-og,hybrid,"Jesus OG -- also known as Jesus OG Kush -- was developed while attempting to create a Sour Kush strain. 

Developed by West Coast seed bank TGA Genetics, the goal was producing a fruity-smelling hybrid with lemon flavor undertones to pair with its classic Kush taste. 

TGA co-founder Subcool said the recipe was perfected in 2007 by pollinating a clone-only female -- Hell’s OG that was held by Norstar Genetics -- with pollen from a Jack the Ripper male. 

Jesus OG has two main phenotypes: one with more limonene, which results in a lemony scent reflective of the strain’s Northern Lights #5 ancestry, and one with more Kush-dominant genetics that results in a pinene-dominant terpene profile. 

The high-limonene phenotype is reportedly the more commercial of the two.  

TGA reports cultivators of Jesus OG can expect tall growth and massive yields -- especially when planting outdoors -- with a 50-63 day flowering time. Jesus OG’s leaves are bright green, and its flowers are dense with waxy, trichome-riddled surfaces and prominent orange hair clusters. 

Breeder Subcool describes the Jesus OG high as intoxicating, yet thought-provoking, alleviating pain and providing mental clarity.  The strain was used by breeder Jinxproof to create the 9lb Hammer, which won a cannabis cup in 2017.

Considered to be among the most popular strains offered by DNA Genetics, the first generation of Mean Green seeds actually led to three phenotypes. While the first two phenotypes had slothlike flowering cycles that led to an underwhelming final product, the breeders eventually landed on Type C, which unlike previous iterations, featured a much-improved flavor profile and more potent effects. 

This version of Mean Green went on to win first place for best sativa at the 2005 High Times Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam.

According to the breeder, Type C of Martian Mean Green has an indica-like growth pattern, but with an open structure common to sativa-dominant strains. A short plant that creates more side branches than usual, this particular Mean Green cultivar produces tight, compact buds during a 63-to-70-day flowering cycle. Reported to procure THC levels that can sometimes exceed 20%, DNA Genetics describes Mean Green as having a “powerful psychedelic effect.”

OG Kush,og-kush,hybrid,"OG Kush is a world-famous strain first propagated by Matt Berger in Florida. The strain was later popularized after JoshD was able to perfect the growing conditions and introduce the variety into the Los Angeles market. JoshD Farms reports OG Kush users can expect long-lasting, heavy, yet versatile euphoria and skunky-citrus flavor and aroma. The company is now focused exclusively on developing OG Kush-derived strains and products.

JoshD Farms reports an average THC content of 20% from OG Kush, with some indoor grows testing as high as 26%. Myrcene, Limonene, and caryophyllene are the dominant terpenes of the strain. According to JoshD Farms, phenotypes and offspring that honor OG Kush’s signature effect and flavor profile include Kosher Kush, Triangle Kush, Skywalker OG, and Loompa’s Headband. 

Matt Berger said he obtained the originating strain, a ’90s favorite of Snoop Dogg and B-Real of Cypress Hill, in Florida where it was shared exclusively among local growers under the name Kryptonite, or Krippy, to designate its alleged Seattle origins. It was shipped from Seattle to Florida in dense bricks and also referred to as Supernaut and Kush. 

Del Rosso said the strain was passed between Florida breeders Alec Anderson and Matt “Bubba” Berger in 1992. Berger, who was the first to cultivate Kush seeds in Florida from a random bag of flower, later shared the strain with Del Rosso in Los Angeles. Berger was also reportedly the first to coin the name Kush after a friend called the strain’s especially frosty colas “Kushberries,” with no intentional reference to the Hindu Kush mountains where other “Kush” strains originate.

OG Kush also came in 1st place for the Weedmaps March Madness competition in 2020.","Del Rosso was the first to cultivate Kush in California, sharing cuttings with friends and fellow growers, and renaming it OG Kush (OG being short for “Original,” not “Ocean Grown” or “Original Gangster” as is often rumored) to differentiate his Florida plant from phenotypes cultivated by other breeders. When OG Kush first started to proliferate through the market, many growers reproduced the plant without the right indoor grow conditions, and the results often have varied in quality, effect, and flavor profile. OG Kush is meant to signify that the strain was grown properly by Josh and his original crew of breeders.

JoshD also reports that OG Kush is difficult to grow because it’s highly sensitive to changes in light and nutrient levels and can be susceptible to pests. Successful growers will find OG Kush has a 58-day flowering period and develops sizable yields of triangle-shaped colas covered in oily, shiny trichomes. Sugar leaves are green with streaks of lavender and pink. Testing from Phylos Bioscience reveals moderate genetic variation in the strain.

The resulting strain has a sweet, lemony flavor profile and about 21% THC, according to the breeder. Pink LemonAid reportedly has  very high resin production, and that there’s little difference between the two versions despite having two fathers.

According to Annunaki, Pink LemonAid has three phenotypes, two heavy sativa and one that leans more toward indica. The sativa-leaning phenotypes grow tall and lanky, flower in about eight weeks, and have average yields.

RD Genetics founder Scott “Moonshine” Reach said the original Rare Dankness strain was a cross between a Ghost OG female and an inbred Chemdawg male from Colorado brothers Alex and Andrew at Reservoir Seeds. 

The Rare Dankness #1 male -- arguably the most prolific iteration of the strain -- was the culmination of four generations of crosses. It began with a hybrid between the original Rare Dankness and a Ghost OG, which was then crossed with a Triangle Kush, then crossed once more with a Triangle Kush. 

From there, Rare Dankness #2, another male, was created using a hybrid of Ghost OG and Rugburn OG. 

Although these varieties were never available to the public, Rare Dankness #1 is a parent to several Rare Dankness hybrids, including Scott’s OG, Rare Darkness and 501st OG. 

Reach said the Rare Dankness #1 male -- which is kept on-hand for current and future breeding -- delivers exceptional potency, enhanced structure and increased yields to strains with which it is hybridized.

Stardawg,stardawg,hybrid,"StarDawg, or Star Dawg, is a cross between a female Chemdawg 4 and a male Tres Dawg. Propagated by JJ Edwards of Top Dawg Seeds in 2011, Star Dawg is said to express a couple of phenotypes, one of which is considered Indica-dominant and the other considered to be Sativa-dominant. 

While the most famous StarDawg pheno, the Guava cut, won first place in the Best Sativa category at the 2012 Denver High Times Medical Cannabis Cup, the strain has been updated and reissued four times since 2011. 

The newest variations from StarDawg’s gene pool are referred to as the Illuminati, Corey Haim, and Kate Upton cuts. Despite sharing the same gene pool, each cut provides a slightly different flavor profile, smell, effect, plant structure, and flowering time. Of the varied cuts, Kate Upton is the most purple, Guava is the sweetest and produces the heaviest yields, while the Corey Haim and Illuminati cuts are claimed to be the most potent.

Dependent on the cut of StarDawg cultivated, the strain will either produce a short, compact, fast-flowering, Indica-dominant plant; or a fast-stretching, rapidly blossoming, Sativa-dominant plant. Indoors, the Sativa-leaning cut of Stardawg will finish flowering in roughly 63-73 days, while outdoor cultivators will need to wait until early October in the Northern Hemisphere, or early April in the Southern Hemisphere before they can harvest. The Indica-dominant cut of StarDawg, grown either indoors or outdoors, will take roughly 65 days to fully mature after entering the flowering period.

Several online sources report Tahoe was developed in the 1980s, but that timeframe is inconsistent with the 1992 emergence of OG Kush -- of which Tahoe OG is a phenotype. In fact, recent genetic testing confirmed certain Tahoe cuts are related to OG Kush.

OG Kush appeared when breeder Matt “Bubba” Burger brought his Florida-grown strain to new, indoor settings engineered by California’s JoshD of JoshD Farms. The OG stood for “original,” and indicated the strain was part of the ’92 cut grown by Burger and his team. 

From there, Ganja Guru moved a step further with Tahoe OG, selecting phenotypes based on THC levels and trichome density.

Tahoe OG grows short and squat, reaching heights of 4 feet in 8-9 weeks of indoor growing. Advanced growers should harvest from the top down, allowing lower buds to gain more light exposure.
